# Restaurant Data Analysis

Ginny is a big fan of Japanese food, so she decided to start a restaurant at the beginning of 2021 that sells his three favorite
foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Ginny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their:
* Visiting patterns
* How much money they’ve spent
* Which menu items are their favorite 

The data set contains the following three tables:
* sales
* members
* menu

## Problem Statements

* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
* What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
* How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
* What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
* Which item was the most popular one for each customer?
* What is the total number of items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
* If each customers’ $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?
